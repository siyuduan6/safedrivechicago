# IS 545 Finals - Drive Safe in Chicago

Drive Safe in Chicago has been deployed on streamlit! You can view the website [here]("https://share.streamlit.io/siyuduan6/safedrivechicago").

Datasets are from [Chicago Data Portal website](https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?category=Transportation&page=1).

The license is the terms of use on the source [website](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/narr/foia/data_disclaimer.html).

There are different types of visualization and interactive charts n the website:

1) Chicago Maps to show the locations of traffic cameras (Red light & Speed);
2) Chicago Maps with the number of recoded crash cases in one or more years selected by drop-down on the sidebar;
3) Bar charts to summarize the causes and damage of car crash accidents;
4) Stacked bar chart to summerize the number of red light violations and speed violations with "YEAR" bar to highlight one or more years popped by clicking the box;
5) Bar chart to display violations for given type of cause in given year selected by drop-down on the sidebar;
6) Scatter plots to compare car crash cases and injuries in the same period selected by brush and click;
7) Area chart of violation cases in Chicago per month from July 2015 to April 2021;
8) Double-bar plots to compare red light violations and speed violations in different year picked by slider.

Libraries used for visualiztions are pyplot, altair, folium and streamlit. Thanks to the developers of these libraries, I could display my charts and graphs on a website.

Thanks Prof.Turk for his instruction in 2021 Spring, and also thanks myself for my hard work. 

Hope everyone stay safe on the road!
